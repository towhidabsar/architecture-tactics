Instructions:

Python 2.7 must be installed.
Simply run "python HBSender.py", and the simulation should start.

Quality Attributes:

Availability:
The control system always has to be available to mitigate any risk to
the nuclear reactor. A heartbeat tactic is used to see if the nuclear 
reactor control system is running. 

Performance:

Performance is another quality attribute that will be necessary, because
it's a nuclear reactor the control system has to react to any issues
as fast as possible in order to mitigate risks.
